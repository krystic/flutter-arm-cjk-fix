# GitHub Repository Mapping for Snap Apps
# 
# This file maps Snap app names to their GitHub repository URLs.
# The script will copy this to /etc/flutter-cjk/github-repos.conf on first run.
#
# Format: snap_app_name|github_repo_url
# 格式：Snap应用名|GitHub仓库地址
#
# The script uses this mapping to auto-detect the Flutter version used by each app.
# If an app is not in this list, the script will try to detect it from snapcraft.io.
